## openZIM BitTorrent Super-seeder

The **openZIM BitTorrent Super-seeder** is a Docker image to easily
launch a BitTorrent super-seeder for all or part of the ZIM files
published at https://library.kiwix.org/zim.

It will share theses files which means concretly automatically:
* Download new ones
* Delete older one

### Principle

This Docker image works as a companion to the
[linuxserver/qbittorrent](https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/qbittorrent)
Docker image. It is responsible the ZIM files served by
[qBittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/) are kept in sync with
upstream https://library.kiwix.org/zim.

### Configure

The instance can be configurd via environnment variables:
* `DOWNLOAD_DIRECTORY_PATH`: directory path you want to have the ZIM files stored
* `DATA_PORT`: TCP & UDP ports for the data exchanges
* `ADMIN_PORT`: TCP admin port for qBittorrent
* `DOWNLOAD_DIRECTORY_MODE=ro` if the ZIM files are already downloaded and you don't want any data to be downloaded from qBittorrent.

You can gather this conf in an environment file for example and run for example:
```bash
env $(env .env) docker-compose ...
```

### Run

The easiest solution to run the solution is to use
[docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). Doing so, you will
be able with a simple command to start/stop the two Docker containers
(qBittorrent and the super-seeder companion).

To launch the service:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

To stop it:
```bash
docker-compose stop
```

### Advanced

Here are a bit of documentation for developers or users wanting to go
a bit more in depth with the solution.

#### qBittorrent

Refers to https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/qbittorrent

#### Companion

To launch the companion:
```bash
docker run --network="host" --name=qbittorrent-zim-superseeder openzim/qbittorrent-zim-superseeder
```

To build the companion from the source code:
```bash
docker build -t openzim/qbittorrent-zim-superseeder .
```
